### FAQ

#### Do I have to buy *RubySteps: The Playbook*?

Nope! Sign up for the 21-day challenge, and I will send you the first four games for free! You can use the games to complete the challenge, and I'll be here to help you every step of the way. [Buy the *Playbook* and you'll get 9 extra games that will help you ship Ruby applications](http://www.rubysteps.com/playbook/), plus my undieing gratitude :)

#### I've finished 20 days and I'm going out of the country tomorrow - can I still get in to *RubySteps Heroes' Hall*?

It depends! If you successfully complete the challenge by sending pull requests to this repo on 21 consecutive days before [12pm mountain time](http://everytimezone.com/#2015-4-1,360,cn3), then yes! If you send your 21st at 12:01pm... nope :( Them's the guidelines of the challenge.

#### Can I take the challenge multiples times?

Yep! You can take it as many times as you want. The first time you successfully complete it, you'll be inducted in to *RubySteps Heroes' Hall*. After that, it's just gravy :)

#### Do I have to sign up for the challenge mailing list?

Yes - until you've successfully completed it. It's how I keep track of who's doing it, and stay in touch with you. If you're not on the list, and you haven't been inducted in to *RubySteps Heroes' Hall*, I will close your pull requests without merging. Sorry :( I'm doing my best to make this easy on you - try to meet me at least 0.1%! :)

#### When does it start?

The next adventure begins on Monday, April 13th. Join in on the fun!
