### tl;dr - [The Rules, abridged](#the-rules-abridged)

# *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*

This README explains the project repository. For meta information about the project, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/RubySteps/21-day-challenge/wiki).

If you ever have any questions, you can always [email @patmaddox](mailto:pat@rubysteps.com). Even better is to check out the examples from all the other people who have worked through the challenge. There's a whole community here of people [doing it and helping others do it](http://agilemanifesto.org) - all you have to do is follow our lead! :)

## Global directory structure

The main directories you see at the top-level are `1_warmup`, `2_adventures`, `3_heroes`. They represent the top-level goals that you'll work towards throughout the course of the challenge.

### Before you begin, it's important to warm up!

When you embark on the challenge, you'll follow a specific naming convention for your work. You need to learn the convention before you can participate in the challenge... otherwise I'd have to keep explaining how it works, and things would slow down to a crawl!

`1_warmup` is the training area where you get warmed up for the challenge. You can do your warm up at any time. Check out [the warmup README](1_warmup/README.md) for information, along with all the fine examples from people who have done the warmup before you.

### Let the adventure begin...

Once you've warmed up, you can participate in an [adventure](2_adventures/README.md). While you can do your warmup at any time, adventures run on a strict schedule. I intend to begin a new adventure on the first Monday of each month. If there's an adventure in progress, you'll have to wait until the next one.

Each directory within the `2_adventures` folder represents a 21-day adventure. [2_adventures/001](2_adventures/001/README.md) is for the first adventure, `002` is for the second, and so on.

Within each adventure folder, you'll find personal sub-directories for each person joining on that adventure. When you join an adventure, you'll have your own folder. Within that, you'll create a new sub-directory for each day that you participate in the challenge, numbered sequentially so we can keep track of your work.

Why the sequential naming scheme? First, it makes for a great way to track progress and see momentum. A commit log is nice... but what if it takes you 50 commits to write 5 lines of code? You can't really see how much work you've done. Second, sequential naming forces you to work in the context of one day - it has a beginning and end. *You finish something every day*, no matter how small. In other words, *you ship* - which is what great programmers do.

To complete each step of the challenge, you'll need to create a sub-directory for that step/day of the challenge. There are only two rules:

* you must prefix the sub-directory with a 2-digit representation of the step (01, 02, 03_my_awesome_day are all valid examples)
* you must create a README.md in each step sub-directory

That's really it. Do that, and you've completed the step. Of course, you can do more than just create a README...

Once you've got your daily step completed, send a pull request!

#### Miss a step, and you're out

If you don't send a pull request each day of the challenge, or you don't get a pull request merged because it doesn't meet the criteria (and you fail to fix it in time!) then you're out of the adventure. No exceptions (even - no, *especially* - for @patmaddox ;)

If you get eliminated, then I'll just close any pull requests that you send for that adventure. So please don't, because you'll just add lots of noise and distract me from helping the people working through the challenge. You'll have to wait until the next adventure... and of course you can take it as many times as you want!

The rules are simple, and the warmup gets you ready for the challenge, so that's not a factor. You also have a growing community of people that can help you out.

Life happens. *Please do not feel guilty* if you can't complete the challenge the first time around, for any reason at all. We'll be here waiting to go on another adventure with you, when you're ready, as many times as you want.

### When you successfully complete the 21-day challenge...

What do you get when you successfully complete the challenge? A few things...

1. Momentum. You'll have a streak of *at least* 21 days on your GitHub profile, which is pretty awesome. And you'll feel motivated to keep it up.
2. Lots of new software. Work every day, and you'll have created new programs - totally awesome!
3. Learning. You can't do this and not learn. I guarantee it, or your money back ;)
4. Connections. Look at all the people contributing. These people are actively learning, and helping one another learn. They're the kind of people you want to become friends with...

That's all the inherently awesome stuff you get *just from sticking with the program for 3 weeks*. To sweeten things a little bit more, I've got the [3_heroes](3_heroes/README.md) directory patiently waiting for the folks who complete the challenge. As of today, 0 people have completed it, so I'm not quite sure what it will be! At the very least, it's a list of all the people who have completed the challenge. Anyone can start anything, but it takes serious commitment to finish things. If you manage to stick it out, you deserve recognition.

### *RubySteps* Standard Time

A *RubySteps* day begins on [12:00pm mountain time](http://everytimezone.com/#2015-4-13,360,cn3) and ends at 11:59am on the following calendar day. WATCH OUT FOR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS. You're a programmer, so you already know how messed up time is. If you don't... well, I apologize in advance for the frustration you will face for the rest of your programming life.

Please see the [2_adventures/README](2_adventures/README.md) for info on the current day of the challenge.

### The first three days are free

All 21 days are free! But you get a free pass for the first three days. You can't get eliminated in the first three days, for any reason - including because you signed up on day 3.

If you got your warmup right, but your first adventure pull request wrong... don't sweat it, you can go to sleep that night knowing that you have two more days to fix it.

If you miss the first couple days because you were busy, or you forgot, or you were sick, or you just didn't feel like it... you can still join in on the fun!

You just have to get your house in order by the end of day 3, and you're good to go. This means:

* you have your two warmup directories done
* you have the first three adventure days done

You can do them all on day 3 if you need... but you can't rush ahead. You may not submit day 2 on day 1.

This is to give you a chance to catch up, and to cut yourself some slack. By the end of day 3, you know the drill. From that point on, it's up to you. You need to participate every day, or you get eliminated from that adventure. You're either rolling with us, or you're watching from the sidelines. Both are cool, but rolling with us is waaaaaay cooler ;)

## Tell your friends!

Aren't you glad somebody told you about the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*? Don't you want to help someone else out, big time? Tell your friends to [sign up for the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*](http://www.rubysteps.com) and join us on our next adventure. Everything is better with friends! :)

# The Rules, abridged

1. You must warm up before participating in an adventure.
2. You get a free pass through the end of day 3 - you can fix any mistake, for any reason.
3. Starting day 4, you must submit a well-formed pull request every day for the rest of the challenge.
4. Miss a day, and you're eliminated from that adventure. You can join in on the next one.
