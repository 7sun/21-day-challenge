# RubySteps 21-Day Challenge

Everyone you know has some sort of Ruby mentor - except for you - and you're missing out on EVERYTHING.

Where do the nice, smart programmers hang out? In the *RubySteps Heroes' Hall*, of course! :) Successfully complete the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*, and you're automatically inducted in to the hall. As an offering of thanks, you'll get:

* your name on the *RubySteps Heroes' Hall* page for all to see
* commit access to the RubySteps/21-day-challenge repository, so you can help other prospective heroes along their journey
* exclusive access to our heroes-only chat room, where you can hang out with Ruby programmers who take massive action

All you have to do is **complete the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge***. It's easier than you think, and I will help you every step of the way :)
