# *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge* warmup

Let's get you warmed up and ready to go for the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*! To complete the challenge, you'll need to send a valid pull request every day.

What makes a valid pull request?

1. It is for files *only* within your personal sub-directory.
2. It contains a single sub-directory for that step of the challenge.
3. The single sub-directory has a README.md describing what you did.
4. It does not contain any files unrelated to your work (tmp files, backup files, etc)
5. It comes from a topic branch, not `master`
6. It is rebased off of the upstream master (doesn't end with a merge commit)

**To warm up for the challenge, you must send two valid pull requests. You will not get to participate for the challenge until you're warmed up.**

You will prefix sub-directory names with the step of the challenge, formatted as two digits.

*Valid sub-directory names:*

* `01`
* `02_pat`
* `03_pat_loves_to_code`

*Invalid sub-directory names:*

* `1`
* `one`
* `pat_01`

## Example pull requests:
