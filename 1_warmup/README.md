# *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge* warmup

Let's get you warmed up and ready to go for the *RubySteps 21-Day Challenge*! To complete the challenge, you'll need to send a valid pull request every day.

What makes a valid pull request?

1. It is for files *only* within your personal sub-directory.
2. It contains a single sub-directory for that step of the challenge.
3. The single sub-directory has a README.md describing what you did.
