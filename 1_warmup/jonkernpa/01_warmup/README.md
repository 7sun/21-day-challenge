# 01 Warm Up

## Commit #1

* After forking the project
* I created a new feature branch

    `jk-warmup-1`

* I created this file/folder
* I committed the work
* I pushed to remote

    `git push origin jk-warmup-1`

* Then I went to my github account, on the forked version of 21-day-challenge
* saw my new topic branch
* clicked the `pull requests` icon
* which told me I had none, so i clicked `create a pull request`
* then I chose my topic branch to compare against master
* and I clicked `create pull request`

Wow, is collaboration really this hard? I bet I am doing something wrong.


Normally I have used Reenhanced's git reflow gem to make this magically not so hard.
