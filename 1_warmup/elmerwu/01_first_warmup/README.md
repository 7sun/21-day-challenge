This is my first commit for the warmup exercises before the 21-day-challenge.

I got here by:

- forking the RubySteps 21 Day Challenge Repo
- creating a sub dir for my additions
- creating the directory for the first warmup, "01_first_warmup"
- creating the README.md file for the 01_first_warmup dir
- commiting my changes
- pushing up and then submitting a pull request
